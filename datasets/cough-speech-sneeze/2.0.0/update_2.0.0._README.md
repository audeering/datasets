For version 2.0.0. all files containing coughing and sneezing have 
been re-evaluated. If there is too much silence or other noises before or after
the event, will the event be classified as 'other' and removed in this version.
It is okay if there is some background (speech, music, etc.),as long as the event 
clearly is in the foreground.
