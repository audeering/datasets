# Gender labels

MOSI comes not with gender labels,
we only get the following information from the [MOSI
paper](http://sentic.net/multimodal-sentiment-intensity-analysis-in-videos.pdf):

> We selected a total of 93 videos from 89 distinct speakers, including 41
> female and
48 male speakers. 

To still have gender labels,
@hwierstorf annotated them manually
and added the results here as `gender.csv`.
